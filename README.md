PROJECT GOALS

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# Team Roles and Responsibilities

Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizatizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
UI/UX Designer: Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs. Creates user journeys for the best user experiences and highest conversion rates.

#Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design Overview

# Feature Breakdown

 User Authentication: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
 Property Management: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
 Booking System: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check- 
  out details.
 Payment Processing: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
 Review System: Post and manage reviews for properties.

#API Security Overview
 Implement and document key security measures to safeguard application data and 
 ensure secure transactions.

Authentication
User Login/Signup: Secure password storage using bcrypt (hashing + salting).
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for session management (short-lived tokens with refresh tokens).
OAuth 2.0: Optional social logins (Google, Facebook).
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Optional for added security.

Authorization
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different permissions for guests, hosts, and admins.
Resource Ownership Checks: Users can only edit/delete their own listings, bookings, or reviews.

Rate Limiting
API Throttling: Limits on login attempts and API calls (e.g., 100 requests/minute per IP).
Brute-Force Protection: Temporary lockouts after repeated failed login attempts.

Data Security
HTTPS: All communications encrypted via TLS/SSL.
Input Sanitization: Protects against SQL injection and XSS attacks.
Sensitive Data Masking: Credit card/PII hidden in logs and responses.

Payment Security
PCI Compliance: Payments processed via Stripe/PayPal (no direct card storage).
Monitoring & Logging
Activity Logs: Track login attempts, payments, and admin actions.
Suspicious Alerts: Notifications for unusual activity (e.g., multiple logins from different locations).

Secure APIs
CORS Restrictions: Only trusted domains can access APIs.
API Key Authentication: Required for third-party integrations.

#CI/CD PIPELINE

CI (Continuous Integration): Automatically builds and tests code changes when pushed to a shared repository (e.g., GitHub). Ensures new code doesn’t break the app.
CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment): Automatically deploys tested code to staging/production environments after CI passes.

Why It’s Important
Faster Releases: Automates testing and deployment, reducing manual errors.
Early Bug Detection: Catches issues before they reach production.
Consistency: Ensures all deployments follow the same reliable process.

Tools We’ll Use
GitHub Actions: For CI/CD workflows (runs tests on every git push).
Docker: Containerizes the app for consistent environments.
AWS/GCP: Cloud platforms for deployment (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
SonarCloud: Optional for automated code quality checks.
